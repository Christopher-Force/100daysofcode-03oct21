	<h1>First day of #100DaysOfCode</h1>
	<p>The purpose of this small project was not to be pretty, but instead to learn how to interact with HTML and CSS by utilizing JavaScript.</p>
	<p>This was done with Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation and events.</p>
	<p>All of us could be doing something a little more in the day. Why not test some of your thoughts here? They're not saved, as a heads up.</p>
	<p>Thanks for checking my progress!</p>
